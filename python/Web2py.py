"""
Web2py standalone version
=========

The webpage www.sbtab.net offers several tools for the handling of SBtab and SBML files. It is implemented in the Python-based and publicly available web framework web2py. We are offering the source code of a web2py server with the implementation of the SBtab webpage. It is a standalone version of web2py that can be launched without a connection to the internet. The source code can be found in the git repository under SBtab/web2py and its launch is described on www.web2py.com.

The web2py framework does not require any prerequisites to run. It is, however, crucial to have the packages installed that are needed by the application SBtab. These are:

- python 2.7 or higher
- numpy (numerical operations for python)
- libsbml (SBML manipulation for python)
- re (regular expression module for python)
- tablib (table handling library for python)

The provision of this web2py standalone version does not only offer the scripts that are used for the SBtab webpage, it also enables the user to modify or use the implementation for own purposes. If you are experiencing troubles running the web2py server, do not hesitate to contact Timo Lubitz (timo.lubitz@hu-berlin.de).
