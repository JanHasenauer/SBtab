This is the first prototype release of the SBtab Excel Add-in. It provides basic features for importing SBML which will generate the SBtab tables, and exporting the tabs back to SBML again. Rudimentary validation is included as well.

Next to the source archives you will also find a binary installer. This installer bundles a compiled version of the add-in, Python 2.7 (32bit) as well as SBtab. So it can be installed with a double click. Once installed the add in is registered with Excel 2013 and will be active from the Add-ins menu.
